\title{Image Data Extraction\\
Requirement and Specification Document\\
21st March 2017\\
Version 1.0
}
\date{}
\maketitle


\section{Project Abstract}
This project is aimed to deliver the data from image in the form of organised data. By organised data we implies text from image stored in text document.
\section{Document revision history}  
Rev 1.0 21st March 2017 – initial version

\section{Customer}
The reach of our product is in every section of the society like, students, teachers, researchers, data management companies, every department where data from images are used. There is no section of the society in this technological environment who doesn’t require information from the text instantly and in the organised way. So, we provide them a better way to manage data from images and make their life easy.

\section{Competitive Landscape}
Today every one want android application for each and everything so, the basic difference between us and other online available OCR is the ease of converting the text in image into a text document which can later be edited. Icing on the cake android application makes it feasible to capture image anytime, anywhere offline or online it doesn't matter. If they provide with the desktop software you need to transfer your image to the desktop and then you are able to convert it into text document.
We will provide a better interface and better product.

\section{System requirements}
\textbf{Dummy Customer: Student}\\
Today most of the students need synapses from a text book for making their notes (i.e. data available in hardcopy required as softcopy), and typing all that data from a book into a text document is time consuming. \\
\textbf{The first requirement:} conversion of image text in text document.\\

Students require on the spot text from the book as softcopy.\\
\textbf{Second requirement:} subject image to be taken directly from camera.\\

Students have lots and lots of pre-clicked images from which they want data.\\
\textbf{Third requirement:} subject image to be included from gallery.\\

Students need the application working in offline mode also.\\
\textbf{Fourth requirement:} all the features working in offline mode also.\\

Students need the application to run fast.\\
\textbf{Fifth requirement:} use of tensorflow to make the app run faster.\\

Students require application to process accurate text recognition.\\
\textbf{Sixth requirement:} use of image processing before extraction.\\
